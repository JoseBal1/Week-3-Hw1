# Week-3-Hw1
Homework 1


-Vector Comparison class- Compares the runtime between Vector and Arraylist to see which is better to use.

-Generic Container class- Allows for the user to create a vector of whatever type they'd like to create.

-InventorySystemMain Class- Its where the method is created and has a vector created for orders and products. It also has an user interactive menu that allows the user to input their own products and orders. 

-Order Class- Allows for Order to be used in other classes. Has methods allowing orders to be added to a vector, removed, found and find the overall total values of orders.

-OrderItem Class- Allows for Orderitem to be used in other classes. It allows the user to create items for the order and it has getters and setters for the variables inside the class. 

-OrderManager- Creates a vector that contains the orders and has methods that changes the status of an order depending on whether it is delivered, pending or Cancelled, a method that allows the orders to be searched through by their order status and customer name. 

-Product Class- Creates a product using a product id, name, category, price, and quantity. Getters and setters for all of these along with a way to update the stock of an product.

-ProductInventory Class- Creates a vector where products can be inputted and has methods that allows products to be added, removed, searched for by their product id. Has a method to sort by category and low stock. Has a method to calculate total value of the inventory and a print method.




In order to run the program its best to have all of these classes on your device so that the InventorySystemMain can use them. Everything should work correctly and no errors popped up while testing this. 

Some assumptions I made about this assignment is that I assumed it was not going to be as time consuming as it was. I also assumed that it would be the parts of the homework would be a little less difficult.


Challenges I encountered were that I procrastinated and it took longer than expected to actually finish it. Also in the part where we had to do the Comparison between Vector and Arraylist is where I did struggle for quite a bit. 


I learned that vectors are similar to Arraylist but they do have their downsides. Like the fact they are thread safe meaning only one thread can access a vector at a time. I also learned that generics is an efficient way to reuse code for all types of data in java without causing much error.
